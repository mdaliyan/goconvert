## Pull Requests

Looks like you want to help out on `govert`. awesome! Here's a couple things to keep in mind when contributing.

1. This repository is not a large one, but please be sure you created a new branch before start coding. It's a good habit.
2. If your PR contains multiple commits, try to keep those commits succinct, with descriptive messages. This makes it easier to understand your thought process.
3. If your PR fixes or references an open issue, be sure to reference it in your message.
4. If you're adding new functionality, make sure your code has good test coverage.
5. Run `go test` before submitting.
